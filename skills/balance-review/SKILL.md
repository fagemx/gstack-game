## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_GD_VERSION="0.1.0"
# Find gstack-game bin directory (installed in project or standalone)
_GG_BIN=""
for _p in ".claude/skills/game-review/../../../gstack-game/bin" ".claude/skills/game-review/../../bin" "$(dirname "$(readlink -f .claude/skills/game-review/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null)/../../bin"; do
  [ -f "$_p/gstack-config" ] && _GG_BIN="$_p" && break
done
# Fallback: search common locations
[ -z "$_GG_BIN" ] && [ -f ".claude/skills/gstack-game/bin/gstack-config" ] && _GG_BIN=".claude/skills/gstack-game/bin"
[ -z "$_GG_BIN" ] && echo "WARN: gstack-game bin/ not found, some features disabled"
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/sessions
touch ~/.gstack/sessions/"$PPID"
_PROACTIVE=$([ -n "$_GG_BIN" ] && "$_GG_BIN/gstack-config" get proactive 2>/dev/null || echo "true")
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
_TEL_START=$(date +%s)
_SESSION_ID="$-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"balance-review","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "PROACTIVE: $_PROACTIVE"
echo "GD_VERSION: $_GD_VERSION"
```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest gstack-game skills.

## AskUserQuestion Format (Game Design)

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** Project, branch, what game/feature is being reviewed. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Plain language a smart 16-year-old gamer could follow. Use game examples they'd know (Minecraft, Genshin, Among Us, etc.) as analogies.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — include `Player Impact: X/10` for each option. Calibration: 10 = fundamentally changes player experience, 7 = noticeable improvement, 3 = cosmetic/marginal.
4. **Options:** Lettered: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` with effort estimates (human: ~X / CC: ~Y).

**Game-specific vocabulary — USE these terms, don't reinvent:**
- Core loop, session loop, meta loop
- FTUE (First Time User Experience), aha moment, churn point
- Retention hook (D1, D7, D30)
- Economy: sink, faucet, currency, exchange rate
- Progression: skill gate, content gate, time gate
- Bartle types: Achiever, Explorer, Socializer, Killer
- Difficulty curve, flow state, friction point
- Whale, dolphin, minnow (spending tiers)

## Completion Status Protocol

DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / BLOCKED / NEEDS_CONTEXT.
Escalation after 3 failed attempts.

## Telemetry (run last)

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
[ -n "$_GG_BIN" ] && "$_GG_BIN/gstack-telemetry-log" \
  --skill "balance-review" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
  --used-browse "false" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
```


# /balance-review: Game Economy & Balance Review

TODO: Full implementation. Sections to build:

### Section 1: Difficulty Curve（難度曲線）
- Flow state analysis (challenge vs skill over time)
- Spike detection (sudden difficulty jumps)
- Recovery mechanics (what happens after repeated failure)

### Section 2: Economy Model（經濟模型）
- Currency flow diagram (ASCII art: sources → player → sinks)
- Inflation/deflation projections
- Exchange rate clarity

### Section 3: Progression Pacing（進度節奏）
- Time-to-milestone mapping
- Grind ratio (effort per meaningful unlock)
- Content runway (how long until player runs out of new stuff)

### Section 4: Monetization Pressure（付費壓力）
- Free player viability scoring
- Paywall timing analysis
- Whale/dolphin/minnow experience comparison
